## What are vector stores
A vector store is a system designed to store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors.

## Key Features
**1. Storage** - Ensure the vectors and their associated metadata are retained, ehether in-memory for quick lookups or on-disk for durability and large-scale use.

**2. Similarity Search** - Helps retrieve the vectors most similar to a query vector.

**3. indexing** - Provide a data structure or method that enables fast similarity searches on high-demensional vectors(e.g., approzimate nearest neighbors lookups).

**4. CRUD Operations** - Manage the life cycle of data adding new vectors, reading them, updating existing entries, removing outdated vectors.

## Use cases - 
1. semantic search
2. RAG
3. Recommender Systems
4. Image/Multimedia search
